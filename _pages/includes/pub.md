- **Abstract**: The increasing worldwide incidence of diabetes has created a pressing demand for accurate and reliable glucose monitoring. Nevertheless, conventional machine learning methods exhibit limitations in trustworthiness and personalization, while deep learning methods with excellent trustworthiness underperform in accuracy and responsiveness. To realize an equilibrium, we propose an efficient model named GluPIDHW. Built upon an optimized Holt–Winters architecture augmented by a PID controller, GluPIDHW achieves improved accuracy and enhanced responsiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on five recognized datasets and out-of-distribution tasks demonstrate the superiority performance of GluPIDHW over excellent counterparts. This leadership is further validated by a Friedman testing and collectively, GluPIDHW offers a promising paradigm for continuous glucose monitoring and data-driven medical diagnose.
- **Core Idea**: Analogy from PID controller to Holt-Winters model.
- **Domain**: Time Series Forecasting, Diabetes, Glucose Monitoring

[GluConv: Toward Trustworthy Convolutional Modeling for Sequential Signal Forecasting](https://github.com/SuperBearcafedo/GluConv)\\

- **Abstract**: Sequential signal forecasting is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, requiring models that simultaneously achieve high accuracy, responsiveness, trustworthiness. Existing shallow machine learning approaches provide fast inference but frequently lack trustworthiness in long-term supervision, while deep learning methods with improved reliability typically suffer from reduced responsiveness and degraded accuracy performance. To address these limitations, GluConv, an efficient convolution-based forecasting framework, is proposed. Accuracy, trustworthiness, and responsiveness are well balanced and preserved. GluConv nearly builds upon multi-scale convolutional units to capture both variate correlation and temporal dependency in sequential signals. Extensive experiments on continuous glucose monitoring benchmarks demonstrate that GluConv consistently outperforms excellent machine/deep learning baselines on reliability and responsiveness, while maintaining competitive accuracy. These properties make GluConv a **Conv**incing, **Conv**olutional, and **Conv**enient scheme for trustworthy forecasting.

- **Core Idea**: Combine U-Net and Convolutions.

- **Domain**: Time Series Forecasting, Diabetes, Glucose Monitoring

[GlucoMixer: An Efficient Glucose Monitoring Model with Mixers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11464084)\\
**Sijie Xiong**, Jianing Wang, Tao Sun, Cheng Tang, Fumiya Okubo, Atsushi Shimada

[**Project**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11464084) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

- **Abstract**: With the global prevalence in diabetes and scarcity of definitive clinic schemes, the need for effective and reliable glucose monitoring has become imperative. Due to excellent responsiveness and precision, machine learning (ML) models have been widely employed by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, recent studies have raised concerns that ML-based models often exhibit limited trustworthiness, injecting uncertainty into medical practices. In contrast, deep learning (DL) models are recognized as more trustworthy, but they are struggling with accuracy. To strike a balance between accuracy and trustworthiness, we propose GlucoMixer, an Encoder-only architecture built predominantly with Mixer modules. To prevent future information leakage, we design a Mask Block that employs a lightweight triangular masking scheme. Given the presence of two diabetes types, we employ a convolutional layer to distinguish relevant information and take two Time Mixer Blocks to handle distinct patterns accordingly. Comprehensive In-Distribution (ID) and Out-of-Distribution (OD) evaluations across five benchmark datasets highlight GlucoMixer's superior performance in high predictive accuracy alongside excellent trustworthiness. According to the test ranking, GlucoMixer is more balanced across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating its potential as a practical spur for reliable glucose management and medical decisions.
- **Core Idea**: Combine linear projections and mask techniques to achieve a lightweight model.
- **Domain**: Time Series Forecasting, Diabetes, Glucose Monitoring

[KPMG: A Graphical Koopman-Mamba Approach for Financial Markets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11461257)\\
**Sijie Xiong**, Cheng Tang, Fumiya Okubo, Tsubasa Minematsu, Yinlong Hu, Atsushi Shimada

[**Project**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11461257) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='4FA6C0AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC'></span></strong>

- **Abstract**: Financial markets reflected by indices are substantial components of global economy. While existing models have achieved significant forecasting performance, they struggle to balance temporal and variate dependencies, which results in a trade-off between predictive accuracy and trustworthiness. Moreover, current models suffer from disturbances and impurities embedded in the financial data. To address these challenges, we propose KPMG, an efficient architecture that integrates the strengths of Mamba and Graph Neural Networks. With crucial features emphasized by Koopman operator and both temporal and variate dependencies mixed up in KPMG, accuracy and trustworthiness are significantly advanced. Extensive experiments on nine leading benchmarks across three index datasets demonstrate that KPMG has superiority over counterparts in prediction performance, while remaining acceptable computational complexity. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each designed module. The Friedman test consolidates the superiority of KPMG over counterparts.
- **Core Idea**: Leverage Mamba, graphical neural network (GNN) to predict financial markets.
- **Domain**: Time Series Forecasting, Finance, Index Forecasting
